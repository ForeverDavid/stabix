How to set a user configuration file ?

1) Copy and paste a default YAML configuration file in the same folder.

2) Rename this new YAML file by replacing 'default' by your username.
In Matlab, type getenv('USERNAME') for windows machine or getenv('USER') for Mac, to get your username.


3) Then, change the default configuration without modifying fieldnames !

N.B.: YAML configuration files of user have to be in the same folder as default YAML configuration files !
