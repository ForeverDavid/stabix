How to set your user YAML configuration files ?

1) In Matlab Command Window, call the function 'username_get' stored
in the 'util' folder of STABiX repository, to determine your username.

2) Rename the folder 'username' with your own username...

3) Rename the YAML configuration files inside this folder by replacing 'username' by your own username.

4) Then, change the default configuration without modifying fieldnames !
