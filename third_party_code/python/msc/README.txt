A Python package for pre- and postprocessing of crystal plasticity
finite element simulations with MSC Marc/Mentat.

For more information, visit http://czam.de/software

Used in many of the publications at http://czam/pub

Features:

 * Parametrically write procedure files from which finite element models can be generated in Mentat.
 * Manipulate MSC.Marc input decks (*.dat files).
 * Convert the result file formats (t16 files) into vtk files that can be 
   displayed with Paraview.
