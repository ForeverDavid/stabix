Residual Burgers vector
-----------------------

Kacher and Robertson (2012)
...........................

Kacher and Robertson analyzed slip transfer in 304 stainless steel (fcc structure), using in situ TEM deformation [#KacherRobertson_2012]_.
In this work, a bicrystal with a misorientation angle of 36° and misorientation axis of [-11, -22,  -2] is characterized.
Dislocation/grain boundary interactions are analysed and knowing the incoming system, the magnitude of residual dislocation Burgers vector is plotted in function
of possible outgoing systems. Calculations are reproduced using the |matlab| toolbox and obtained values are compared to Kacher's results (see Figure 1).

Patriarca et al. (2013)
.......................

Patriarca et al. analysed the deformation response of a FeCr polycrystal (bcc structure) by a combination of EBSD and DIC characterizations [#Patriarca_2013]_.
The magnitude of residual dislocation Burgers vector is plotted for numerous grain boundaries, knowing incoming and outgoing slips.
Calculations are reproduced using the |matlab| toolbox and results are compared to Patriarca's results (see Figure 2).

Kacher and Robertson (2014)
...........................

Kacher and Robertson analyzed slip transfer in alpha cp-Ti (hcp structure), using in situ TEM deformation [#KacherRobertson_2014]_.
In this work, a bicrystal with a misorientation angle of 32° and misorientation axis of [1 5 -6 16] is characterized.
Dislocation/grain boundary interactions are analysed and knowing the incoming system, the magnitude of residual dislocation Burgers vector is plotted in function
of possible outgoing systems. Calculations are reproduced using the |matlab| toolbox and obtained values are compared to Kacher's results (see Figure 3).

Cui et al. (2014)
.................

Cui et al. analyzed slip transfer in proton-irradiated 13Cr15Ni stainless steel (fcc structure), using in situ TEM deformation [#Cui_2014]_.
In this work, two bicrystals with respectively a misorientation angle of 60° and 40° and a misorientation axis of [1, 1, -1] and [1, 0, 1] are characterized.
Dislocation/grain boundary interactions are analysed and knowing the incoming system, the magnitude of residual dislocation Burgers vector is plotted in function
of possible outgoing systems. Calculations are reproduced using the |matlab| toolbox and obtained values are compared to Cui's results (see Figure 4).

m' factor

Guo et al. (2014)
.................

Guo et al. analyzed slip transfer in cp-Ti (hcp structure), by tensile test combined to in situ digital image correlation [#Guo_2014]_.
In this work, many bicrystals are characterized and slip band–grain boundary interactions are analyzed in term of stress concentration along the slip plane direction.
The :math:`m'` factor is used to quantify the transmissivity across the GBs and calculations are reproduced using the Matlab toolbox (see Figure 5).
