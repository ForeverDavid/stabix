MWN2 Matlab tools
=======================================
The MATLAB\ :sup:`TM` \ toolbox **STABiX** (Slip Transmission Analysis in Bi-Crystal) provides a unique and simple way to analyse slip transmission in a bicrystal.
A Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) is implemented in order to import EBSD results, and to represent and quantify grain boundary slip resistance.
Key parameters, such as the number of phases, crystal structure (fcc, bcc, or hcp), and slip families for calculations, are set by the user.
With this information, grain boundaries are plotted and color coded according to the :math:`m'` factor :cite:`luster_compatibility_1995` that quantifies the geometrical
compatibility of the slip planes normals and Burgers vectors of incoming and outgoing slip systems.
Other potential functions that could assess the potential to develop damage are implemented (e.g. residual Burgers vector
:cite:`marcinkowski_dislocation_1970,bollmann_crystal_1970`, :math:`N` factor :cite:`livingston_multiple_1957`, critical resolved shear stress :cite:`bieler_role_2009`, misorientation...).
Furthermore, the GUI provides the possibility to plot and analyze the case of a bicrystal, and to model spherical indentation performed
close to grain boundaries (i.e. quasi bicrystal deformation).
All of the data linked to the bicrystal indentation (indenter properties, indentation settings, grain boundary inclination, etc.) are collected through the GUI.
A Python file can be then exported in order to carry out a fully automatic crystal plasticity finite element simulation of a bicrystal 
indentation using one of the constitutive models available in DAMASK :cite:`zambaldi_orientation_2012,roters_damask:_2012`.
In this way the stress and strain fields close to the grain boundary can be rapidly assessed.
