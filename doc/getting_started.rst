===============
..    include:: <isonum.txt>

First of all, download the source code of the Matlab toolbox.

`Source code is hosted at Github. <https://github.com/czambaldi/stabix>`_

Then, run the Matlab script `path_management.m <../../../path_management.m>`_, in order to set search paths for Matlab.

Finally, run one of these GUIs to play with the toolbox.
