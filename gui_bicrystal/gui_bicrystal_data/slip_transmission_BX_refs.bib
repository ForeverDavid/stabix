	abstract = {The interaction of lattice dislocations with grain boundaries in proton- and ion-irradiated austenitic stainless steels is investigated. At the macroscale, interactions of dislocation channels with grain boundaries result in slip blockage, slip transmission and slip along the grain boundary with an associated in-plane displacement. At the dislocation level, slip transmission prediction is governed by the strain energy density minimization. However, the importance of the local resolved shear stress increases, in the sense that it must be of sufficient magnitude to propagate the dislocations through the damaged matrix. If this condition is not satisfied, the grain boundary will activate an alternative mechanism to relieve the strain accumulated from accommodation of lattice dislocations and the stress concentration associated with the formation of a dislocation pile-up. One observed relief mechanism involves the nucleation and propagation of a crack along the grain boundary, which is accompanied by an out-of-plane displacement of the boundary.},

	abstract = {The interaction between slip bands and grain boundaries in commercial-purity titanium was examined using cross-correlation-based electron backscatter diffraction. At a low strain level, three types of interactions were observed: blocked slip band with stress concentration; slip transfer; and blocked slip band with no stress concentration. The stress concentration induced by the blocked slip band was fitted with Eshelby{\textquoteright}s theoretical model, from which a Hall{\textendash}Petch coefficient was deduced. It was found that the Hall{\textendash}Petch coefficient varies with the individual grain boundary. We investigated the geometric alignment between the slip band and various slip systems to the neighbouring grain. Stress concentration can be induced by the blocked slip band if the slip system is poorly aligned with ?a? prismatic, pyramidal or basal slip systems in the neighbouring grain. Transfer of slip across the boundary occurs when there is good alignment on ?a? prismatic or ?a? pyramidal slip systems. Other stress-relieving mechanisms are possible when the best alignment is not with the slip system that has the lower critical resolved shear stress.},

	abstract = {The application of diffraction contrast electron tomography to dynamic experiments involving dislocation interactions with grain boundaries is demonstrated for the first time. Two applications are shown: the first is concerned with post-mortem analysis of dislocation interactions with grain boundaries and illustrates the usefulness of the tomography technique for defect analysis; the second is in conjunction with in situ straining experiments in which the dynamics of dislocation interactions with grain boundaries are observed directly and the resulting structure visualized three-dimensionally. The in situ straining experiments were conducted at room and elevated temperatures to determine the influence, if any, of thermal processes on the slip transfer mechanism. It was found that increasing the temperature lowers the barrier for dislocation absorption and emission from the boundary and increases the complexity of the interactions, but does not change the fundamental mechanisms governing slip transmission. Previous experimentally determined criteria for slip transmission across boundaries were extended to interactions involving partial dislocations, where it was found that the reaction continues to be governed predominately by reduction of the Burgers vector of the residual grain boundary dislocation left after slip transfer.},

Static experiments, performed by using the electron beam as a heating source, proved that slip propagation across the interface is possible when the angle of intersections between the activated slip planes of the incoming and the outgoing dislocations with the boundary plane is minimised. Additionally, the Burgers vector of the residual dislocations left in the boundary after slip transmission occurred should also be minimised. Due to their very small Burgers vector, residual dislocations are visualised with satisfactory results by an image simulation method.},

	abstract = {Grain boundaries induce heterogeneities in the deformation response of polycrystals. Studying these local variations in response, measured through high resolution strain measurement techniques, is important and can improve our understanding of fatigue damage initiation in the vicinity of grain boundaries and material hardening. In this work, strain fields across grain boundaries were measured using advanced digital image correlation techniques. In conjunction with strain measurements, grain orientations from electron back-scattered diffraction were used to establish the dislocation reactions at each boundary, providing the corresponding residual Burgers vectors due to slip transmission across the interfaces. A close correlation was found between the magnitude of the residual Burgers vector and the local strain change across the boundary. When the residual Burgers vector magnitude (with respect to the lattice spacing) exceeds 1.0, the high strains on one side of the boundary are paired with low strains across the boundary, indicating the difficulties for slip dislocations to penetrate the grain interfaces. When the residual Burgers vector approaches zero, the strain fields vary smoothly across the boundary due to limited resistance to slip transmission. The results suggest that the residual Burgers vector magnitude, which relates to the {GB} (Grain Boundary) resistance to slip transmission, enables a quantitative analysis of the accumulation of strain at the microstructural level and the development of strain heterogeneities across grain boundaries. The results are presented for {FeCr} bcc alloy which exhibits single slip per grain making the measurements and dislocation reactions rather straightforward. The work points to the need to incorporate details of slip dislocation{\textendash}grain boundary interaction (slip transmission) in modeling research.},
